# Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial. Learning data structure is a requirement for anyone who wants to succeed with software development, thus taking advantage of this tutorail will help start with the right foot your studies of Python.

We are going to focus on the following data structures:

- [Queues](1-queues.md)
- [Sets](2-sets.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)


Each data structure will be presented with descriptions and some examples. You will also have a problem to solve on your own so you can practice your new learned skills. Make sure to only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem by yourself first.

Don't forget to read our recommendations and final remarks at the [Conclusion](4-conclusion.md) of the tutorial.
