# Queues

## What is a Queue?
A queue is a data structure that uses the First In First Out (FIFO) approach (*see image below*) to store items in a linear order. Just like a line in a bank, the first to arrive is the first to be attended, in other words, "the least recently added item is removed first" (1).

## When to use a Queue?
It's first important to understand that queues are everywhere, we might not notice due to all the abstraction that we have in our software and programming languages. Some examples are:
* Scheduling asynchronous threads to be executed
* Operating systems use queues to organize their processes
* Server receive requests and organize them in queues

In other words, anytime you need to work with things in a first in, first out system, a queue is your data structure to go.
